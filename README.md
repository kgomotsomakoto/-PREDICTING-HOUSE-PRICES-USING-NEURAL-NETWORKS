# -PREDICTING-HOUSE-PRICES-USING-NEURAL-NETWORKS

## OBJECTIVE
Predicting home prices accurately poses a significant challenge due to various influencing factors like property attributes, location, economic conditions, and market dynamics.
Buyers rely on precise estimates to make informed investment decisions, ensuring they secure fair deals without overpaying.
Sellers benefit from understanding their property's value, allowing them to set competitive prices and maximize profits.

### AIM:

Develop robust house price prediction models. These models, by considering a multitude of variables including property features, economic indicators, and market trends, aim to provide accurate predictions aligned closely with actual sales prices
